            <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Michael Haggard. I'm a 24 year old programmer from Kansas.
                I'm currently attending a full stack web development coding bootcamp through the University of Kansas, and have
                an Associate's Degree in Computer Science from Northern Oklahoma College. I'm looking to begin a career in web development, and 
                I am always striving to further improve my skills.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>On this site, you'll find examples of my programming work as well. As of writing this, my portfolio is quite bare. Despite this,
                I have experience in several programming languages. These include Visual Basic, Java, and C++, as well as web development frontend
                languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have some experience working with Ruby through basic video game development. While
                I plan on a career in web development, I really enjoy every aspect of coding. In addition to programming experience, I also have experience
                in other aspects of IT. I've worked for a defense contractor (details fall under a NDA, unfortunately) running an advanced WiFi network, and
                have built networks for several organizations and non-profits.

            <br>
            <p>My current projects are a simple WordPress blog located <a href="http://teamzxcv.com">here</a>, various assignments for my programming class, and a very long-term
                RPG for mobile phones. I plan on expanding my portfolio and refining my skills in order to build a career for myself and my family. Feel free to use the contact
                page if you need to reach me through email.

            <p>Outside of programming, I spend most of my time with my four wonderful children
                and my beautiful wife. I listen to way too much music, enjoy fine bourbon, write and worldbuild, 
                and, of course, play video games. Since 2017, I've made it my goal to listen to as much new music as possible.
                That year I managed to listen to over 200 albums, possibly even more. I listen to almost every type
                of music at least a little bit, but my favorite genres include hip hop, black metal, industrial, death metal
                and hardcore punk, but I'm not picky at all, Like most programmers, I also love to play video games. 
                I also develop video games as a hobby, although many of them will never see a release. I'm married with four
                children: 3 boys (two of which are twins!) and a daughter. Life at home is very busy, but I've mastered the
                skill of time management. All in all, I'm a pretty normal person who just wants to build a future
                for my children and have fun doing it - hence being a programmer!
